Alternative 4 - A virtual desktop environment

The company has hired four new consultants who are going to be a part of an IT project. They need several virtual machines to use as virtual desktops with VNC so they can work from home. They now request the following servers:

      - Four virtual machines with at least two CPU’s each for virtual desktops
      - Each of the four needs the following users: (john - alice - bob - kate)
      - The virtual desktop machines need the package «ubuntu-desktop» installed
      - One storage server with NFS server installed
      - One database server running MongoDB
      - All virtual desktops need to run the vnc service and have it installed 
            (there are several packages available, just pick one. you don’t have to configure VNC, but it is a nice exercise. )
